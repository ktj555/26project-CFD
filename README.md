  <summary>What is CFD?</summary>
  <div markdown="1">
    
    CFD is Computational Fulid Dynamics  
      
    In fuild dynamics,  
    general equations, called Navier-Stokes equations, can't be solved analytically.  
      
    So, we can have numerical solution only.  
    CFD solve ns-eqn to numerical analysis.
    One way operating CFD is FEM(Finite Element Method).
