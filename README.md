# Project AI

### Object
* __Compute velocity profile__ by using Encoding Decoding Convolution Neural Network added TBNN
  * Very fast calculation speed compared other CFD simulation
  * Great accuracy  
is satisfied(hope)

  <summary>What is CFD?</summary>
  <div markdown="1">
    
    CFD is Computational Fulid Dynamics  
      
    In fuild dynamics,  
    general equations, called Navier-Stokes equations, can't be solved analytically.  
      
    So, we can have numerical solution only.  
    CFD solve ns-eqn to numerical analysis.
    One way operating CFD is FEM(Finite Element Method).

### Implementations
* Read 3D Cad file
* Slice modeling
* Input slicing modeling data in AI
* Save result in csv file
* Visualizing Results

### Additional
* Language : Python, matlab(for create training data sets)
* Enviroment : VScode & jupyter notebook or others
* Develop period : 8 weeks

### PLAN
|index|note|
|--|--|
|1|Study Blender Mesh importer for 3D modeling file convert to csv|
|2|Create training data set using comsole(CFD-simulator)|
|3|Create AI model and training|
|4|Test algorithm|
